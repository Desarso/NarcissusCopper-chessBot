current bugs 

the black pawn don't seem to be able to eat white pieces sideways,
there is an error using the movePiece command to eat pieces.

Black queen can't move diagonally,
pawns can't eat non pawns.

Need to keep entire game history so that I can go back,
which mean I need to have pgf for the games. 

Also need a checkmate indicator.
