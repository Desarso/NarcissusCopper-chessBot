So I need to make a droppable creator,
Implement a way of deactivating dropables from the onDropFunction,
needs to be an option from the front end

Then I can get started on remaking the chessBoard, and adding touch functionality,
I will try to make it as simple as possible, hopefully the chessLogic being seperate from the UI will help
Then UI will obviously display info from the chessClasses, and also
I need to run a board refresh on everyMove, I can make a function for that


For every move
Call legalMoves function and checkmateFunction, update, the board state. I also need to take the legal moves, and use that for the move suggestions to the opponent,
