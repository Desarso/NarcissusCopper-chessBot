current bugs


pawsn can not be crowned

the board shits itself when the bottom tank is empty
need to fix the fen string generator

there is no checkmate indicator

the app is set I need to add backspace as well as crowning

//there are hella bugs, the worst one is the fact that the board will randomly miss checks.



//in particular kings don't seem to be able to recognize pawn attacks
//yup they are completely blind to pawn attacks.
//I am able to move into a move tha immediatly eats me afterwards.
