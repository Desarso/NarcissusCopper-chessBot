need to add pgf or whatever is called for full move history,
also I am yet to add castling and pawn promotion;

It's very simple I have a front end engine that checks when a pawn
makes it to the end zone, then I have a UI pop-up for user input
that then calls the move function but since it is a pawn to the end zone
it needs to also have a promotion piece type so that the piece,
that it is actually replaced with is the promoted piece



Also need a checkmate indicator or end game indicator.

For later: 

Add game timers, add numbers and letters to UI board, and the pieces
that have been taken to the side, make a better UI with optional live texting,
maybe even voice comms. Take free inspiration from chess.com.

Make your front end much simpler, think about the things you want the app,
to be able to do, get rid of the things that will take time or are unnecesary.

I short I want you to be able to play against real players, and to add a friends list.
Then you should be able to challenge players to a game, which would then send you a notification.
This would shop up as a pop-up request, as well as being in your notifications button.

Also you should be able to play with different AI's at different levels.
Chess.com makes the UI very friendly by making use of characters, and each of them 
has character attributes associated with them. I would suggest you use a similar idea
however, use AI generated faces for the AI profiles, and the use the 
GPT-3 ai to come up with different responses.
