current bugs


pawsn can not be crowned

the board shits itself when the bottom tank is empty
need to fix the fen string generator

there is no checkmate indicator

the app is set I need to add backspace as well as crowning


//so the way I am going to revert my game is that I need to run the game moves backward,
//this is difficult becuase the fen string also needs to revert to the previous arrangement
//the easiest way to do this would be to just have a stack of board, but I want to be able to traverse the game
//so need to able to go forwards and backwards, and then choose a different move, so 
//in conclusion, I can push the fen strings, into an array, then the back button basically grabs the previous fen string, 
//create a new board, and then replaces the current board with that board,
//then I just run update board.
//much easier to implement than the portable game format, maybe it's like messed up with it's probably fine.
//here's the thing update board will need to take pieces from the stack.
//if it's the same type it does not really matter, but for the board update, I basically want to 
// remove all the pieces from the UI and into an array, loop 64 times, and then paste the correct piece,
//into the correct board position according to the board
//so it is completely independent of anything else, and it is slightly more computational than the current update function.
