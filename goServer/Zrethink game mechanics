I have a lot of specializes requests.

Lets genralize a bit and rethink the way the game is played in multiplayers. 
There is also a bit of delay on the front end when logging in. 

all data structures that are stored in cash as array need to be deleted after a certain amount of time offline. 
Games are only deleted if one of the players is gone for a long time. 
Players are not deleted if they are in game, even when going offline.

So a player logs in. The name should be injected immediatly into the name list rather than waiting for the fetch for added responsiveness.

Just got an error, the server froze.
Likely due to too much server compute, 
or an error with the Go graphql that made the 
server freeze.

For some reason the game is no longer working

There are errors when beginning a game.
for some reason, in chrome the screen goes dark more often than not. We need to make this fully reliable.

So the begin game function must be changed to be fully reliable. It must have error checking to self correct.

I am unable to eat pieces in firefox.
After dragging, if dropped in the same spot the piece will become undragable
sad face.
