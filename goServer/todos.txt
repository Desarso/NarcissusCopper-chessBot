-add a delete game query to the schema
-scratch that add a create, mutate, and delete function to every single class type in the query schema
-then make the server automatically keep track of the games age, and delete it's self, after a certain amount of time
-of the users being gone.

-switch all live data to websockets, and make them have real time updates, including age, and player online status.


limitations:
    even tho ws are both ways subscription are really only one way and I can not send update to the server via subs.
    so what I can do is send continuous updates to the client, and use heartbeat updates for the server.
    

Idea
    Create entire scheam from scratch and make better names for the mutations and queries
