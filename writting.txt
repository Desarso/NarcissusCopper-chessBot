To_Do's

Castling is now being tracked with letter T vs R and,
need to ass castling to the rookmoves function, and then write a condition in the 
moves function to deal with castling
So the move function only stores two values, which is not enough to represent castling.
Castling should be represented with special repeated numbers.
99,98,97,96.

turning the rooks to a different letter needs to be handled in the move function since that is the function
that generates the new chessboard, and the other function only generate moves.
might separate the individual move functions into another file to simplify the file.


Top-Left corner: (99,99);
Top-Right corner: (98,98);
Bottom-Left corner: (97,97);
Bottom-Right corner: (96,96);
