To_Do's

Castling is now being tracked with letter T vs R and,
need to ass castling to the rookmoves function, and then write a condition in the 
moves function to deal with castling
So the move function only stores two values, which is not enough to represent castling.
Castling should be represented with special repeated numbers.
99,98,97,96.

turning the rooks to a different letter needs to be handled in the move function since that is the function
that generates the new chessboard, and the other function only generate moves.
might separate the individual move functions into another file to simplify the file.


Top-Left corner: (99,99);
Top-Right corner: (98,98);
Bottom-Left corner: (97,97);
Bottom-Right corner: (96,96);



Design ideas for UI, customizable board colors, 
the board color should be random everytime the player goes inside
there should be a button for resetting pieces to normal
need to have a system for the pawn to turn into a queen once it reaches the 
end of the board.
Once most of that is done then the I need to finish up the AI,
and add multiplayer to the chessBot.
