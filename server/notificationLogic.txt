So I want to create a subscription that only returns an array, of my notifications.

Workflow
-click on users
-triggers function that will randomly select color, and ready data
-functions send a mutate query that creates a notification for that specific userID
-subscription to individual subscriptions, will trigger a pop up to ask for gameplay
-notification is deleted upon click, or upon expiring, in around 2 minutes. Or if the user goes offline.
-Upon accepting, a create game mutate is triggered. This needs to check in the backend that both players are still online.
-A game is created, both players are assigned a color, and their boards are displayed appropriately.
-all moves from opponent are animated, and one can not move the opposing pieces.
-pieces that are consumed are shown below.
-name tag is shown
