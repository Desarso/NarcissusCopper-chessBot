So when the user clicks on the user in the list, that is not themselves. 
They will send a mutate id.

What we want is to send a notification to the specific user. 

I want to create a subscription only to my specific user.

So I want to create a subscription that only returns an array, of my notifications.

Workflow
-click on users
-triggers function that will randomly select color, and ready data
-functions send a mutate query that creates a notification for that specific userID
-subscription to individual subscriptions, will trigger a pop up to ask for gameplay
-notification is deleted upon click, or upon expiring, in around 2 minutes. Or if the user goes offline.
-Upon accepting, a create game mutate is triggered. This needs to check in the backend that both players are still online.
-A game is created, both players are assigned a color, and their boards are displayed appropriately.
-all moves from opponent are animated, and one can not move the opposing pieces.
-pieces that are consumed are shown below.
-name tag is shown

Game object Workflow
-upon moving a mutate function will add a move to the game object array of moves.
-both users will be subscribed to the game.
-if the subscripion triggered by the game contains a move, from other user, then the move is accepted.
-We should also keep track of total moves, to make sure we don't update board to a previous state.
-Eventually I would like to be able to have a back track button, that is able to display the previous moves.
-similarly to chess.com.
-Upon game completion, a screen pops up, showing the winner, and the game object is deleted, and well as the subscripton which is ended.
