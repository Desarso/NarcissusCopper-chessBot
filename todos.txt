Need to remove games if they don't receive any update for a few hours
or if neither of the players are online


-fix crowning
-add game over screen
-add game over screen for draw
-add letters and numbers to board
-make board square again
-add a way to see previous moves like in chess.com
-remove built up games from the server in the background.
-make it such that a player goes back into it's assigned game if they refresh
-such that a player is not logged out of a game for a significant amount of time
-also when the player logs in, it's ID should be checked against the current games.
-make players logged in status a web socket, such that responsiveness is immediate and I am not querying.
