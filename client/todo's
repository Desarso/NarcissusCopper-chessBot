Re-do the black pieces from mom such that they keep a white background 
--re-write the entire front-ui using classes, 2D moves, and a game function to keep track of game state.
functions to check for possible moves, and also can turn the board to a fen string on every turn.
Make the API as nice an usable as possible.  
Make methods small and simple.
whenever possible create an abstraction, this benefits from using test. For now I can simply use try catch on every method to pin point where the error is occuring.
