I need to think about how to update the user leaving the page

So the user object should have a last seen property
Everytime the user updates the graphql in any way it should update the last seen property to the current time
Then every let's say 2 minutes the back end will loop thru the current users online, and if the last seen property is longer than 
say 3 minutes it will remove that user.
So the user will by default update it's last seen property every 2 minutes.
It should keep a copy of it's own data, so that it know if it needs to update.


//how can I keep local storage, session, and backend in sync?
//well this is what I need to design.

I check if the users exists in session or local storage, for front end actions.
