I need to think about how to update the user leaving the page

So the user object should have a last seen property
Everytime the user updates the graphql in any way it should update the last seen property to the current time
Then every let's say 2 minutes the back end will loop thru the current users online, and if the last seen property is longer than 
say 3 minutes it will remove that user.
So the user will by default update it's last seen property every 2 minutes.
It should keep a copy of it's own data, so that it know if it needs to update.


//how can I keep local storage, session, and backend in sync?
//well this is what I need to design.

I check if the users exists in session or local storage, for front end actions.


So whenever, I am subscribing to the users, including myself, but I want to
update a parameter inside the user object whenever I take any action.

This seems kinda hard, maybe I should do this on the front end.  I simply add a function, to all my query functions
//that mutates my user. 

Then the graphql server, will have a loop function every two minutes, it will only trigger, if there are users in the list.
So basically it checkes the users age, if it more than a certain amount, it deletes them, and then. If there are still users on the list, it will
re-run the function. Otherwise, it exists. Also the function get's triggered, upon a user being added, if it is the first user being added.
