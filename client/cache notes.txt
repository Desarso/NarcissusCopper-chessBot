current bugs


pawsn can not be crowned

the board shits itself when the bottom tank is empty
need to fix the fen string generator

there is no checkmate indicator

the app is set I need to add backspace as well as crowning

//there are hella bugs, the worst one is the fact that the board will randomly miss checks.
there is a strange rook2.move is not function error
I have no idea what it means.
//it only seems to happen when I eat the rook
//it probably has to do with the Board
castling rights not updating after I have eaten a rook
//or some error in the castling mechanics
//so I should make sure the castling mechanics check the the rook EXISTS
//or make sure that the rook being eaten gets rid of the castling rights


//in particular kings don't seem to be able to recognize pawn attacks
//yup they are completely blind to pawn attacks.
//I am able to move into a move tha immediatly eats me afterwards.
